Pangenome Graph Queries in Calyx
================================

This is a nascent project to build a DSL-to-hardware compiler using [Calyx][] to implement pangenomic graph queries in the vein of [odgi][].
It is very much a work in progress.

Getting Started
---------------

You will need to fetch some useful inputs by typing `make fetch`.
This downloads some simple [GFA][] data files.
