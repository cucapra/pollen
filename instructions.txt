Sorry that the testing process isn't super automated right now! 
This will be fixed very soon in the near future. For now, here's 
how to do the differential testing:

Part 1: Odgi 
- On some .gfa file, run the following linux command:
odgi build -g [FILENAME].gfa -o [FILENAME].og
- Then, run the depth algorithm:
odgi depth -i [FILENAME].og -d > odgi.txt
- Then, run the post processing python script:
python3 process.py odgi.txt

Part 2: Python!
- Run python3 depth.py [FILENAME].gfa

Now, run:
diff odgi_output.txt python_output.txt

If you don't see anything, the test passed!
