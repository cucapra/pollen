FlatGFA: An Efficient Pangenome Representation
==============================================

.. py:module:: flatgfa

`FlatGFA`_ is an efficient on-disk and in-memory way to represent
pangenomic variation graphs. It can losslessly represent `GFA`_ files.
Here's a quick example::

    import flatgfa
    from collections import Counter

    graph = flatgfa.parse("something.gfa")
    depths = Counter()
    for path in graph.paths:
        for step in path:
            depths[step.segment.id] += 1

    print('#node.id\tdepth')
    for seg in graph.segments:
        print('{}\t{}'.format(seg.name, depths[seg.id]))

This example computes the `node depth`_ for every segment in a graph.
It starts by parsing a GFA text file, but FlatGFA also has its own efficient
binary representation---you can read and write this format with
:func:`load` and :meth:`FlatGFA.write_flatgfa`.

The library is on `PyPI`_, so you can get started by typing
``pip install flatgfa``.

API Reference
-------------

Loading Data
''''''''''''

The FlatGFA library can both read and write files in two formats: the standard
`GFA`_ text format, and its own efficient binary representation (called
"FlatGFA" files). Each of these functions below return a :class:`FlatGFA`
object. Parsing GFA text can take some time, but loading a binary FlatGFA file
should be very fast.

.. autofunction:: parse

.. autofunction:: parse_bytes

.. autofunction:: load

GFA Graphs
''''''''''

The :class:`FlatGFA` class provides the entry point to access the data either
loaded from a FlatGFA binary file or parsed from a GFA text file. Most
importantly, you can iterate over the :class:`Segment`, :class:`Path`, and
:class:`Link` objects that it contains. The :class:`FlatGFA` class exposes
:class:`list`-like containers for each of these types::

    for seg in graph.segments:
        print(seg.name)
    print(graph.segments[0].sequence())

These containers support both iteration (like the ``for`` above) and random
access (like ``graph.segments[0]`` above).

.. autoclass:: FlatGFA
   :members:

The GFA Data Model
''''''''''''''''''

These classes represent the core data model for GFA graphs:
:class:`Segment` for vertices in the graph,
:class:`Path` for walks through the graph,
and :class:`Link` for edges in the graph.
The :class:`Handle` class is a segment--orientation pair: both paths and links
traverse these handles.

.. autoclass:: Path

.. autoclass:: Link

Iteration
'''''''''

The FlatGFA library exposes special container classes to access the
:class:`Segment`, :class:`Path`, and :class:`Link` objects that make up a GFA
graph. These classes are meant to behave sort of like Python :class:`list`
objects while supporting efficient iteration over FlatGFA's internal
representation.
